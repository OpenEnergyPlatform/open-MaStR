    Generates the current version.

    The version number is determined according to a fixed release cycle,
    which is by convention in sync with the changes to other german regulatory
    frameworks of the energysuch as GeLI Gas and GPKE.

    The release schedule is twice per year on 1st of April and October.
    The version number is determined by the year of release and the running
    number of the release, i.e. the release on April 1st is release 1,
    while the release in October is release 2.

    Further, the release happens during the day, so on the day of the
    changeover, the exported data will still be in the old version/format.

    see <https://www.marktstammdatenregister.de/MaStRHilfe/files/webdienst/Release-Termine.pdf>

    Examples:
    2024-01-01 = version 23.2
    2024-04-01 = version 23.2
    2024-04-02 = version 24.1
