## [v0.10.0] Unreleased - Refactoring - 2020-10-08
A complete refactoring took place! Downloading data was entirely changed; introducing layers of code and removing 
duplicated code while more of less following DRY. 
Moreover, post-processing was changed to be more accessible and easier to execute. For example, docker now helps to 
spin up a database container.
The documention on RTD was extended, update and improved to be more helpful for new users.
