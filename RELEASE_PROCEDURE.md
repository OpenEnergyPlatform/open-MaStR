## GitHub and PyPI Release

### 1. 🐙 Create a `GitHub Issue`
* Named `Release Patch v0.12.1`
* Use `📝ISSUE_TEMPLATE_RELEASE` (❗ToDo❗)
* Discuss a good and suitable name of the release
* Define a day for the release

▶️ This issue documents the status of the release!

### 2. 🐙 Create a `GitHub Project`
* Create [New classic project](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/open-MaStR/projects?type=classic)
* Use the project template *Automated kanban with reviews*
* Named `Release v0.12.1`
* Add a meaningful description
* Track project progress

▶️ It gives an overview of open and finished issues and pull requests!

### 3. 🐙 Create a `Draft GitHub Release`
* [Draft a new release](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/open-MaStR/releases/new)
* Enter the release version number `v0.12.1` as title
* Summarize key changes in the description
    * Use the `generate release notes` button provided by github
* Save draft

### 4. 🐙 Finish all planned Developments
* Some days before the release, inform all developers
* Merge the open pull requests
* On release day, start the release early to ensure sufficient time for reviews
* Merge everything on the `develop` branch

### 5. 💠 Create a `release` branch
* Checkout `develop` and branch with `git checkout -b release-v0.12.1`
* Update version for test release with e.g. `bump2version patch`. To specify version numbers manually use `bump2version --current-version <current_version> --new-version <new_version> patch`
* Commit version update with `git commit -am "version update v0.12.1a1"`
* Push branch with `git push --set-upstream origin release-v0.12.1`

### 6. Check release on Test-PyPI 

* Check if the release it correctly displayed on [Test-PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/open-mastr/#history)
* With each push to the release branch or the branch `test-release` the package is released on [Test-PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/open-mastr/#history) by GitHub workflow (test-pypi-publish.yml).
  * Note: Pre-releases on Test-PyPI are only shown under `Release history` in the navigation bar.
  * Note: The branch status can only be released to a version on Test-PyPI once. Thus, for every branch status that you want to see on Test-PyPI increment the build version with `bump2version build` and push afterwards.
* Once testing on Test-PyPI is done, change the release version to the final desired version with `bump2version release`
  * Note: The release on Test-PyPI might fail, but it will be the correct release version for the PyPI server.
* Push commits to the `release-*` branch

### 7. 📝 Update the version files
* `📝CHANGELOG.md`
    * All Pull Request are included
    * Add a new section with correct version number
    * Give the suitable name to the release
* `📝CITATION.cff`
    * Update `date-released`

### 8. 🐙 Create a `Release Pull Request`
* Use `📝PR_TEMPLATE_RELEASE` (❗ToDo❗)
* Merge `release` into `production` branch
* Assign two reviewers to check the release
* Run all test
* Execute the software locally
* Wait for reviews and tests
* Merge PR and delete `release` branch

### 9. 💠 Set the `Git Tag`
* Checkout `production` branch and pull
* Check existing tags `git tag -n`
* Create new tag: `git tag -a v0.12.1 -m "open-mastr release v0.12.1 with PyPI"`
* This commit will be the final version for the release, breath three times and check again
* Push tag: `git push --tags`
* If you messed up, remove tags and start again
    * Delete local tag: `git tag -d v0.12.1`
    * Delete remote tag: `git push --delete origin v0.12.1`

### 10. 🐙 Publish `Release` on GitHub and PyPI
* Navigate to your [releases](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/open-MaStR/releases/) on GitHub and open your draft release.
* Summarize key changes in the description
* Choose the correct git `tag`
* Choose the `production` branch
* Publish release

▶️ Release on GitHub!

▶️ In the background the GitHub workflow (pypi-publish.yml) will publish the package 📦 on PyPI!

### 11. 🐙 Set up new development
* Create a Pull request from `production` to `develop`
* Create a new **unreleased section** in the `📝CHANGELOG.md`
```
